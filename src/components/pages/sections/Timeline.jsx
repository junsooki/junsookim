{/*<h4 className="font-semibold"> Undergraduate Researcher at ICAROS Lab(Nov 2024-Present) </h4>
<p> I collaborated with Postdoctoral researcher on reinforcement learning experiments for human-robot cooperative games, exploring innovative ways to enhance interaction between robots and humans. In addition, I engineered a Python-based AI interaction system using the Groq API, which enabled autonomous dialogue between language models. To further improve the systemâ€™s capabilities, I developed Neo4j knowledge graphs that facilitated planning when the discussions within the large language models (LLMs) reached their limitations, enabling more efficient and structured decision-making processes.</p> 
h4 className="font-semibold"> Undergraduate Research Assitant at Takahashi Lab (Nov 2023-June2024) </h4>
                                    <p> I collaborated with graduate students on quantum physics experiments, gaining expertise in quantum mechanics. As part of my work, I developed a C++ program to calculate the standard deviation for N-V center data, optimizing lab data analysis. Additionally, I used Mathematica to calculate detection volumes from research papers, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of experimental results.</p>
